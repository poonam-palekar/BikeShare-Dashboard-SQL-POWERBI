# 🚴‍♀️ BikeShare Business Insights Dashboard

This project analyzes bike-sharing data to uncover business insights such as riders_type, revenue, and profitability across different hours and seasons.
The dataset includes records from two years, cleaned and transformed using SQL and visualized in Power BI.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Combined two yearly datasets using SQL UNION.
- Calculated revenue and profit metrics using cost data.
- Filtered analysis for business hours (7 AM to 9 PM).
- Created interactive Power BI dashboard with key metrics and trends.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **SQL** (for data cleaning and transformation)
- **Power BI** (for data visualization and dashboard)
- **GitHub** (for version control and documentation)

## 📈 Pricing Recommendation Analysis

To complement rider and revenue analysis, a pricing strategy was also evaluated. Based on the 2022 price of **$4.99**, two pricing scenarios were modeled:
- A **10% increase** would raise the price to approximately **$5.49**
- A **15% increase** would raise the price to approximately **$5.74**

### 🔍 Recommended Strategy:
- **Conservative Increase:** Suggests a cautious 10–15% price hike to avoid customer drop-off.
- **Segmented Pricing:** Consider separate pricing for casual vs. registered riders.
- **Monitor and Adjust:** Implement pricing changes but remain responsive to customer feedback and data.
